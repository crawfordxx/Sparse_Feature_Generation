       "'  We present the first truly polynomial algorithm for learning the struc- ture of bounded-treewidth junction trees – an attractive subclass of prob- abilistic graphical models that permits both the compact representation of probability distributions and efficient exact inference. For a constant treewidth, our algorithm has polynomial time and sample complexity, and provides strong theoretical guarantees in terms of $KL$ divergence from the true distribution. We also present a lazy extension of our approach that leads to very significant speed ups in practice, and demonstrate the viability of our method empirically, on several real world datasets. One of our key new theoretical insights is a method for bounding the con- ditional mutual information of arbitrarily large sets of random variables with only a polynomial number of mutual information computations on fixed-size subsets of variables, when the underlying distribution can be approximated by a bounded treewidth junction tree.

    "This assessment measured the understanding of basic text file processing techniques in the Python programming language and extracted data into a proper format suitable for a downstream modelling task.\n",
    "- **Extraction** Defining function is a clear and user friendly way to parse these patent features. [regex101](https://regex101.com/) is a very useful online tool to check the regular expression. And also it can show which part is the group of regular expression. The `re.search` and `re.sub` is used frequently in this part to extract the particular text from main file. Then by using basic funtion like `if else` and `loop` to make judgment and appending function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparse Feature Generation** Firstly, using `tokenization` function to identify the file sentence segmentation. Then, define a `RegexTokenizer` to tokenize all words from paper. Secondly, due to removed vocabularys, put the data into the stop words. Check the difference between th output of `MWEtokenizer` and `RegexpTokenizer` by adpating the following code to make sure we get the right collocation. Rare tokens (with the threshold set to 3%) and meaningless tokens (with the threshold set to 95%) must be removed from the vocab. Thirdly, Using `Porter stemmer` to stem Unigram tokens. Finaly, output vocabulary_index file and count_vector file respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistics Generation** First of all, altering all special markers to space bars. Specially, in the original file, finding that some special characters cannot match `regular expression` package, so we changed these special characters to normal characters. According assignment requirement, the word tokenization must use the following regular expression, `r\"[A-Za-z]\\w+(?:[-'?]\\w+)?\"`. Then, put the matched files into the training model, the file could be recognized whether these are a sentence or not through the training model. Finally,  put the analyzed data into the loop and used `Collections package` to count the frequency of characters showing up in the data."
